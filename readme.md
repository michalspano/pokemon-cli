## A Simple `Pokemon` Game - `CLI` Version

This **repository** contains the source code for the 2nd assignment of the **course** "Object-Oriented Programming" (`DIT043`) offered by the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (`CSE`) at the **University of Gothenburg** and the **Chalmers University of Technology**, Sweden ([link](https://www.gu.se/en/study-gothenburg/object-oriented-programming-dit043)).

### Synopsis

The goal of this assignment is to implement a simple `Pokemon` game in `Java` using the `CLI` paradigm. The game is played by two players, each controlling a team of `Pokemon` characters. The game is played in turns, where each player chooses one of his `Pokemon` to attack the other player's `Pokemon`. The game ends when one of the players' `Pokemon` is defeated. Above, the game implements several other features, as well as a kit with predefined **test cases** for the game (the `pokemontest` package under `src`).
